            Client: When we talk the word Client, it mean to talk of a person or an organization using a particular
            service.
            Similarly in the digital world a Client is a computer (Host) i.e. capable of receiving information or using
            a
            particular service from the service providers (Servers).<br><br>
            Servers: Similarly, when we talk the word Servers, It mean a person or medium that serves something.
            Similarly
            in this digital world a Server is a remote computer which provides information (data) or access to
            particular
            services.Client–server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.[1] Often clients and servers communicate over a computer network on separate hardware, but both client and server may reside in the same system. A server host runs one or more server programs, which share their resources with clients. A client does not share any of its resources, but it requests content or service from a server. Clients, therefore, initiate communication sessions with servers, which await incoming requests. Examples of computer applications that use the client-server model are email, network printing, and the World Wide Web.

        <h2>Components of Web Application </h2>
        
           <center> <img src="components2.jpg"></center><br><br>
        
        <p>
            AAll web-based database applications have three primary components: A web browser (or client), a web application server, and a database server.

Web-based database applications rely on a database server, which provides the data for the application. The database server sometimes also provides business logic in the form of stored procedures. Stored procedures can offer significant performance advantages, especially in a multi-tiered architecture. In addition to database servers, other enterprise information system components include IMS™ databases, WebSphere® MQ messages, and CICS® records.

The clients handle the presentation logic, which controls the way in which users interact with the application. In some cases, the client validates user-provided input. Web applications sometimes integrate Java applets into the client-side logic to improve the presentation layer.

<h3>Applet</h3>
A Java program that is part of a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) page. (HTML is the standard method for presenting web data to users.) Applets work with Java-enabled browsers, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer; they are loaded when the HTML page is processed.
Web application servers manage the business logic. The business logic, typically written in Java, supports multitiered applications. The web application server can manage requests from a variety of remote clients. The web application layer might include JavaServer Pages (JSP) files, Java servlets, Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) components, or web services.

<h3>JSP</h3>
A technology that provides a consistent way to extend web server functionality and create dynamic web content. The web applications that you develop with JSP technology are server and platform independent.
<h3>Servlet</h3>
A Java program that responds to client requests and generates responses dynamically.
<h3>EJB</h3>
A component architecture for building distributed applications with the Java programming model. Server transactional components are reusable and provide portability across application servers.
<h3>Web services</h3>
Self-contained, modular applications that provide an interface between the provider and the consumer of application resources. You can read more about web services later in this information.
ny web application, big or small, contains these major components:
            <br><br>
            View Layer:- When you consider an MVC application, the View layer component gives an interface to the
            application. Regardless if it is for users with a browser or for another application using Web services.
            View
            layer is the bridge for getting the data in and out of the application.
            <br><br>
            It does not have business logic, like calculating interest for a banking application or storing items in a
            shopping cart for an online catalog. It also does not contain any code for existing data to or retrieving
            data
            from a data source. Business logic is managed by the Model layer. View layer is more focused on the
            interface.
            <br><br>
            Business Layer:- It is also known as Business Logic or Domain Logic or Application Layer. The function of
            the
            business layer is to accept user requests from the browser, processes them, and determine the routes through
            which the data will be accessed. The workflows by which the data and requests travel through the back end
            lay
            encoded in a business layer.
            <br><br>
            Data Access Layer:- This layer is built to keep the code you use to pull data from your data store like
            database, flat files, or web services separate from business logic and presentation code. So even if you
            have to
            change data stores, you don’t end up rewriting the whole thing.

        <h2>Types of Web Content </h2>
        
        <center>    <img src="typesofcontent.jpg"></center><br><br>
           
        <p>
            Web content is the textual, visual, or aural content that is encountered as part of the user experience on
            websites. It may include—among other things—text, images, sounds, videos, and animations.There are many different types of content: blog content, website content, newsletter content, profile content, audio & video content, content that makes sales, content that gets links, content that builds relationships.

        <h2>HTTP - HTTP request-response </h2>
        
         <center>   <img src="http.png"></center><br><br>
            
            
        <p>
            HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is invented by Tim Berner. HyperText is the type of text
            which
            is specially coded with the help of some standard coding language called as HyperText Markup Language
            (HTML).HTTP messages are how data is exchanged between a server and a client. There are two types of messages: requests sent by the client to trigger an action on the server, and responses, the answer from the server.
            HTTP/2 is latest version of HTTP, which was published on May 2015.
            <br><br>
            The protocols that are used to transfer hypertext between two computers is known as HyperText Transfer
            Protocol.
            HTTP provides standard between a web browser and web server to establish communication. It is set of rules
            for
            transferring data from one computer to another. Data such as text, images, and other multimedia files are
            shared
            on the World Wide Web. Whenever a web user opens their web browser, user will indirectly uses HTTP. It is an
            application protocol which is used for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.

        <a name="dynamic"></a>
        <h2>Dynamic web pages </h2>
        
           <center> <img src="dynamicwebpage.png"></center><br><br>
            
        <p>A server-side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled by an application server processing server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.

A client-side dynamic web page processes the web page using HTML scripting running in the browser as it loads. JavaScript and other scripting languages determine the way the HTML in the received page is parsed into the Document Object Model, or DOM, that represents the loaded web page. The same client-side techniques can then dynamically update or change the DOM in the same way. Even though a web page can be dynamic on the client-side, it can still be hosted on a static hosting service such as GitHub Pages or Amazon S3 as long as there isn't any server-side code included.

A dynamic web page is then reloaded by the user or by a computer program to change some variable content. The updating information could come from the server, or from changes made to that page's DOM. This may or may not truncate the browsing history or create a saved version to go back to, but a dynamic web page update using AJAX technologies will neither create a page to go back to, nor truncate the web browsing history forward of the displayed page. Using AJAX, the end user gets one dynamic page managed as a single page in the web browser while the actual web content rendered on that page can vary. The AJAX engine sits only on the browser requesting parts of its DOM, the DOM, for its client, from an application server.
            Dynamic Web Pages are written in languages such as CGI, AJAX, ASP, ASP.NET, etc. In dynamic web pages, the
            Content of pages is different for different visitors. It takes more time to load than the static web page.
            <br><br> Dynamic web pages are used where the information is changed frequently, for example, stock prices,
            weather
            information, etc.

        <h2>Application Servers </h2>
        
           <center> <img src="application server.jpg"</center><br><br>
           
        <p>An application server is a server specifically designed to run applications. The "server" includes both the hardware and software that provide an environment for programs to run.
            An application server is a server that hosts applications.<br><br>
            Application server frameworks are software frameworks for building application servers. An application
            server framework provides both facilities to create web applications and a server environment to run them.
            <br><br>
            An application server framework contains a comprehensive service layer model. It includes a set of
            components accessible to the software developer through a standard API defined for the platform itself. For
            Web applications, these components usually run in the same environment as their web server(s), and their
            main job is to support the construction of dynamic pages. However, many application servers do more than
            generate web pages: they implement services such as clustering, fail-over, and load-balancing, so developers
            can focus on implementing the business logic.

        <h2>Web Security </h2>

        <p>
            Web security is also known as “Cybersecurity”. It basically means protecting a website or web application by
            detecting, preventing and responding to cyber threats.
            <br><br>
            Websites and web applications are just as prone to security breaches as physical homes, stores, and
            government locations. Unfortunately, cybercrime happens every day, and great web security measures are
            needed to protect websites and web applications from becoming compromised.
            <br><br>
            That’s exactly what web security does – it is a system of protection measures and protocols that can protect
            your website or web application from being hacked or entered by unauthorized personnel. </p>
